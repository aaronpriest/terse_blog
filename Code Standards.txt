Code Standards:
1. No logical statements, function calls, database calls, variable assignments, etc. in HTML code, only "echo" and "include" statements.
2. Only HTML elements in PHP code, no HTML class assignments, inline "style" declarations, id's, javascript, etc.
3. All include statements that affect the whole page or could be used in the whole page, go at the top of the page.
4. All HTML is mobile-friendly. Never assumes screen size, so "px" is not allowed. Use "%" and "em", except in certain cases
    Note pixels/16=em. But try to stop thinking in terms of px.
