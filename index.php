          <p>Today, the city looks like a yard sale</p>
          <p>Spread carelessly across the sleeping giant's side</p>
  				<p>Without color, without leaves,</p>
  				<p>There is nothing to knit it together.</p>
  				<p>It makes me weary to look at it.</p>
  				<p>There are times. Oh, there are times</p>
  				<p>When I'd like to pick up the edge of it</p>
  				<p>Like my mother would do with sheets from the line</p>
  				<p>And with a great billowing lift and a snap</p>
  				<p>That softly clubs the air</p>
  				<p>Launch all the streets and buildings</p>
  				<p>The twisted metal the twisted metallic dreams</p>
  				<p>Into forgetful Superior</p>
  				<p>And enjoy the quiet of something that has been removed</p>
  				<p>For the birds to sing me back to life</p><p>For the time it takes</p>
