<span class='title'>Crosswalk</span><span class='date'> - September 24, 2013</span><br/>
<span class='postbodytext'>
<p>Naive streets stretch out</p>
<p>Like worn cords,</p>
<p>Woven in lines no one can comprehend.</p>
<p>And we are stuck in the crosshatches,Â </p>
<p>Struggling fish</p>
<p>An indifferent net,</p>
<p>The demands of order hauling us up.</p>
<p>Yet there is a trick in it,</p>
<p>A divine and devious turn.</p>
<p>It's that orange hand on the street light.</p>
<p>So many disobey it thinking they are defeating it,</p>
<p>Or likely feeling to busy for orange hands</p>
<p>When in fact they are playing a very tedious game.</p>
<p>Playing at "making things happen".</p>
<p>I don't keep walking, writhing,</p>
<p>Though, everything tells me I should.</p>
<p>I'll wait for it to turn.</p>
