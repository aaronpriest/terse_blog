<p>It came crushing down.</p>
<p>The ceiling of my bedroom, dust and plaster</p>
<p>I was lifted,</p>
<p>And the rain clouds folded sky-born oceans over me.</p>
<p>The clouds enveloped me,</p>
<p>And I could no longer hear the criticism.</p>
<p>And no one called me “Condemed!”</p>
<p>It was just the wind,</p>
<p>The tops of the trees laughing, but not at me.</p>
<p>And this would be good enough for the time. </p>
<br/>
<p>I do not want you to fill my broken heart</p>
<p>With pasty white songs of vague happiness.</p>
<p>I want you to heal it.</p>
<p>Can you do that?</p></span></body></html>
