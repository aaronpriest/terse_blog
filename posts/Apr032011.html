<p>My heart is also for those who wait</p>
<p>With a star in a window and the fear,</p>
<p>Who have no war to draw their minds</p>
<p>From thoughts of the one who is not there.</p>
<p>One day, when each one has come back</p>
<p>When all the praises are being sung,</p>
<p>Thank those who fought these wars at home</p>
<p>And those who fought them so very young.</p>
