<p>Life, </p>
<p>Both with its repetitions and its irregularities </p>
<p>Together making expectation impossible and unwise,</p>
<p>Then, startling me awake from its lulling rhythms</p>
<p>By some mischievous wave.</p>
<p>If I focus on the rocking of the boat </p>
<p>Or the waves against the shore</p>
<p>I will go crazy expecting that some great difference will appear.</p>
<p>Yet, when I look away</p>
<p>When life is going by nearly unnoticed </p>
<p>A leaf falls into the pond or a branch</p>
<p>It crashes with drama and intensity</p>
<p>Casting ripples that do not easily subside</p>
<p>But become part of the motion</p>
<p>That will be my every day</p>
<p>Drawing from out of the center some energy</p>
<p>That I can neither harness nor re-create.</p></span></body></html>
