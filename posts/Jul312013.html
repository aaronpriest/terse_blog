<p>But I like coffee at night.</p>
<p>Perhaps that is because it is when I most need it.</p>
<p>Unlike many, the morning, to me, is not a pit to dig out of</p>
<p>But more like standing on a grave</p>
<p>With yesterday safely beneath my feet.</p>
<p>Nor am I afraid that it will keep me awake,</p>
<p>For I am always miles from my bed.</p>
<p>But as the sun races to the other side,</p>
<p>I am most likely to feel despair</p>
<p>Slipping down my throat--</p>
<p>A hot, bitter assault, strong, merciless</p>
<p>And black as the night that now surrounds me.</p>
<p>I suppose, when I say it this way,</p>
<p>It does not seem so strange.Â </p></span></body></html>
