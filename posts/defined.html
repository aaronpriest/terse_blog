<p>Hi! This is my poetry blog. Like every other blog, the purpose of this site is to tease meaning out of the ordinary moments in life. Like many, as I go through my day, I notice things, things that I think others may have missed. The difference between this and other blogs is that I try to explain my observations using poetry. </p>

<p>The title of the site "Terse." is intended to convey that these are my first thoughts about an idea and that I am trying to write them in as little space as possible. I try to keep poems to 15 lines, and you may have noticed that I try to use the fewest words possible in the poems and around my uncluttered website.</p>

<p>All of the poetry, webdesign and photos are my original work, unless otherwise indicated. Feel free to request permission to use or reprint any of this material by sending an email with the subject "Permissions" to <a href="mailto:terseblog@outlook.com">terseblog@outlook.com</a>. Permission is free. </p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by. I'd appreciate any of your comments on my work. -AP</p>
