<p>A wonderful thought.</p>
<p>So I cornered it, but it ran through me,</p>
<p>Into the trees.</p>
<p>I chased it dutifully, though my skin was torn,</p>
<p>Though all the brush was trampled upon</p>
<p>Until down it went into a hole in the earth.</p>
<p>I dug at it madly,</p>
<p>And found it had turned to dust,</p>
<p>Mixed into the soil from which it had come.</p></span></body></html>
