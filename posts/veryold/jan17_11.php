<i> - January 17, 2011</i><br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the post that I have not been able to write. There isn't much to it. I mean, the whole point of it is to kick off this blog that I've been trying to get together for several months. But like everything concerning writing, getting started is the most troublesome part.<br/><br/> 
That is not to say that I am not excited about this project. I am. For one, I am proud to say that this website is entirely my creation (with the exception of about five lines of "borrowed" JavaScript). But the other reason I am excited is that I like the format I've chosen for this blog.<br/><br/>
What is it? It is a short account (hence the name “terse”) of the life that goes on  all around me. Life has so few “big moments”. Really, almost everything that happens to us happens over time in smaller events that either build us up or chip away at who we are. It seems to me that taking some time to examine these moments, will reveal some of life's secrets. And perhaps that will be valuable to more than just myself.<br/><br/>
My wish is to do this in the sort of prose that I am using now, but I also want to use poetry. I find poetry uniquely able to uncover  the essence of the critical moments that shape a life. And, if I get the chance, I'd like to try out a kind of ultra-short fiction where you tell an entire story in a certain small number of words, only touching on the key details.<br/><br/>
In doing all this, I hope to remain genuine. I want to avoid being unnecessarily 
negative, sorrowful, or serious. I'd like to present all that I am saying with as much clarity as I can grasp, with sober judgment and with a bit of humor, too--simply because doing so is true to life.<br/><br/> 
I truly hope you enjoy this site. Don't forget to leave a comment with your feedback about what you've read or just mention that you stopped by. <b> AP</b>
