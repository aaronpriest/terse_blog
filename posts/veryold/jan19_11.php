<span id="title">Grief</span>
<span id="text">
<i> - January 19, 2011</i><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth is, grief never ends. At least, it hasn’t for me. And I know that for most people who 
have suffered a loss, there are times when the pain of it is felt as acutely now as the when the loss first
 occurred. I arrived at work today and sat down at my desk set to take on the battles of the day. Suddenly, a thought slipped through the 
 cloud I usually find myself in and fell heavy in my heart: “I lost everything the day the miscarriage happened” and I stifled
   the tears that were hot in my eyes. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 7 years have passed between today and the day my wife and
    I suffered the first of two miscarriages. We’ve since had 3 beautiful daughters. Some might ask then, “How can
     you still be so sad about this?” Many will say such things about a grieving person like, “He never got over the
      death of his wife (or son, daughter, father, mother, etc.)”. Sometimes this is said as if "not getting over it"
       was a pitiable weakness of the person. We feel for them, but we also dismiss their grief, wondering if it is
        really worth so much of their time. Some feel downright contempt for the person, angry that they refuse to move on.
         <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we do this? After all, humans were never meant to die. We were certainly not designed to accommodate
          the people around us dying. Why would it be expected to “get over” this impossible situation? Certainly
           some of the grieving need help moving forward, but why should they ever live as if they do not sense the 
           loss any longer? <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps more tragic is that we treat our own hearts in much the same way. Those of us who 
           would say, “She should be over it by now,” say the same thing to ourselves. When 
           our hearts refuse to stop grieving, we deride it for its foolish recalcitrance. When that doesn’t work, we sedate 
           it with work, meaningless pleasures, whatever it takes. We try to set a bargain. We live life in such a way as to 
           smother grief, at the cost of ignoring our own hearts. But the heart 
           will not accept this--not for long. It eventually makes itself heard, often at the most inconvenient times. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder 
           I (and many others) struggle with truly knowing Christ. He won’t accept the bargain either. He wants us to 
           come to the pain, because he is also there. He remains in our hearts if we’ve asked him there. Refusing 
           our pain is refusing to go where he lives. Though courage is needed to go there at all. <b> AP</b>
