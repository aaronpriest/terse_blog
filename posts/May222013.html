<p>They leave their hearts behind.</p>
<p>When the cares of life </p>
<p>Somehow get exaulted to gods,</p>
<p>When wealth seems possible,</p>
<p>Or at least the wealth of not being destitute,</p>
<p>Makes its way in to the folds of the brain.</p>
<p>And the Judas in the mind says the heart should go</p>
<p>And gets paid for it.</p>
<p>I suspect this will happen to me</p>
<p>If I am not careful. </p></span></body></html>
