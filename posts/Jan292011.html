<p>Oh, I know</p>
<p>We're not aware of it</p>
<p>Because we are upright enough,</p>
<p>Skilled enough,</p>
<p>Okay enough,</p>
<p>We've tried and more than tried.</p>
<p>We have received mercy by this,</p>
<p>This permission to fill a life up full.</p>
<p>Well, as full as one can make it.</p>
<p>And God is kind, oh He is kind!</p>
<p>To let us hold up the world this way,</p>
<p>To breathe in our days,</p>
<p>To have oceans in our eyes,</p><br/>
<p>And to step, though we may</p>
<p>Fall into the life we are scraping out of the earth,</p>
<p>For all our scraping was digging our graves.</p></span></body></html>
