<p> I wish I had said.</p>
<p>Things about cold rainwater</p>
<p>And thoughts you cannot do without.</p>
<p>Thinking that if I had shared my veiw</p>
<p>You would have turned away.</p>
<p>It has always been my thought</p>
<p>That your lack of enthusiasm</p>
<p>Was not a symtom of anything in you</p>
<p>But a silent reaction to a repulsion from me</p>
<p>A force I cannot see</p>
<p>And which I never even thought</p>
<p>I could control.</p>
