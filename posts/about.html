The purpose of this site is to observe meaningful moments that exist in everyday life. As I go through my day, I notice things that have meaning beyond those which we expect to be meaningful (i.e. birth, death, victory, loss, etc.). This is the essence of poetry in all its forms. Poets observe the movements of the soul in relation to the world it inhabits. In poems of 15 lines or less, I'd like to give you my observations and I welcome yours. Enjoy.<br/><br/>
