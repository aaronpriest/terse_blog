<p>I don't carry noise around with me everywhere,</p>
<p>I don't whistle or keep the radio on for no reason.</p>
<p>But when I am surrounded by complaints</p>
<p>And I feel as though I am</p>
<p>Being dragged by the plow,</p>
<p>I find myself in a panic, fearing silence</p>
<p>Like the lost hiker who fled</p>
<p>At the sound of the rescue party.</p>
<p>It just doesn't demand anything,</p>
<p>And demands are the language of this world,</p>
<p>So silence comes, speaking words</p>
<p>Of which, I've forgotten the meaning</p>
<p>But the rhythms haunt me.</p>
<p>And I am secreted away and rescued once again.</p></span></body></html>
