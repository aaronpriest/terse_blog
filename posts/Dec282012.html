<p>I would have liked to set the whole thing on his desk</p>
<p>To see it there taking up space,</p>
<p>Even for a moment, would have been enough.</p>
<p>I have no wish to leap in front of people</p>
<p>But only a need for evidence against the notion</p>
<p>That I bear no weight upon the earth.</p>
<p>When we got within 100 feet of the "salty"--</p>
<p>It was a city on Superior's waves--</p>
<p>We did not cower as it stood over us.</p>
<p>The sailboats danced around it</p>
<p>Like fairies at the ogre's feet.</p>
<p>Then, I wanted to write that I saw these things</p>
<p>I needed to enter it into the record.</p>
<p>So that I could say without a doubt</p>
<p>I was here.</p></span></body></html>
